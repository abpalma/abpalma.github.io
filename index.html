             <b><li>I.T. Experience: Programming / Gaming / Others</b><br> 
             -These are the languages that I learned from senior high school and first year college: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>C++</li>
                    <li>Unity</li></li> 
                </ul>
             <br>

             <b><li>Hobbies / Interests / libangan</b><br> 
             -I like to play computer games like Valorant, and CSGO. I also like to watch some movies and TV series on Netflix.
            </li> 
             <br>

             <b><li>Goals in life / pangarap sa buhay</b><br> 
             -My goal in life is to be a successful web developer. This is one of the things that 
             I enjoy a lot and it gives me joy whenever I finished a project. 
             It doesn’t bother me a lot whenever I encounter problems along 
             the way since it is not avoidable and I always tell myself that no matter happens, it is part of the process.
            </li>
             <br>

             <b><li>What do you expect to learn from this course ?</b><br> 
             -I expect to learn more about programming languages like CSS and Javascript because back in Senior High School I really can’t 
             catch up to my teacher’s programming lessons since at that time I don’t like programming. I just learned the basics of these 
             two languages back when I was a first year college student and I just learned them from watching YouTube videos.
            </li>
             <br>

             <b><li>What do you want to learn to help you in your chosen Major?</b><br>
             -I want to learn more about the programming languages like CSS, HTML, JAVASCRIPT, PYTHON, and SQL since these are one of the most
             important languages for me to be able to gain one step ahead on being a successful web developer.
            </li>
