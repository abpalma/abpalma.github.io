             -My goal in life is to be a successful web developer. This is one of the things that 
             I enjoy a lot and it gives me joy whenever I finished a project. 
             It doesn’t bother me a lot whenever I encounter problems along 
             the way since it is not avoidable and I always tell myself that no matter happens, it is part of the process.

             catch up to my teacher’s programming lessons since at that time I don’t like programming. I just learned the basics of these 
             two languages back when I was a first year college student and I just learned them from watching YouTube videos.
